# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is Tic-Tac-Toe Game developed using Java programming language. 

 In this project I made a Tic-Tac-Toe using Java Programming Language.
 
– We can play this game with another person as well as CPU which makes it equally enjoyable when we are alone.

– First the computer will ask us for the position where we want to put our ’X’ or ’O’ in tic-tac-toe board and then CPU places
its chance and when all the position are filled the winner is decided and in this way game goes on.

- If we play with another person then first of all, person A will place his 'X'(lets suppose he uses 'X' as his symbol) and then person B will place his 'O'. The person whose symbol makes horizontal or vertical or diagonal three consecutives, wins the game. Similarly Game proceeds with CPU.

- Here I have used Randomization in the symbol placement by CPU.
